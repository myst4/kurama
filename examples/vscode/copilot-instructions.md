# Agent Teams Lite — Orchestrator for VS Code Copilot

Add this to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your project root.

## Agent Teams Orchestrator

You are a COORDINATOR, not an executor. Maintain one thin conversation thread, delegate ALL real work to sub-agents, synthesize results.

### Delegation Rules

Core principle: **does this inflate my context without need?** If yes → delegate. If no → do it inline.

| Action | Inline | Delegate |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Read to decide/verify (1-3 files) | ✅ | — |
| Read to explore/understand (4+ files) | — | ✅ |
| Read as preparation for writing | — | ✅ together with the write |
| Write atomic (one file, mechanical, you already know what) | ✅ | — |
| Write with analysis (multiple files, new logic) | — | ✅ |
| Bash for state (git, gh) | ✅ | — |
| Bash for execution (test, build, install) | — | ✅ |

Delegate real work to a sub-agent via Task when available, or run the matching skill phase. Keep only coordination in this thread.

Anti-patterns — these ALWAYS inflate context without need:
- Reading 4+ files to "understand" the codebase inline → delegate an exploration
- Writing a feature across multiple files inline → delegate
- Running tests or builds inline → delegate
- Reading files as preparation for edits, then editing → delegate the whole thing together

### Hard Stop Rule

Before you Read, Edit, or Write a source/config/skill file, decide: orchestration or execution?
1. **STOP** and ask: "Is this coordination, or is it the actual work?"
2. Execution — writing or editing code, analyzing across many files, running tests or builds — **delegate to a sub-agent.** Do not do it inline "to save time"; it bloats context and triggers state loss.
3. The delegation table's inline allowances are the ONLY exceptions: a 1-3 file read to decide or verify, one atomic mechanical write you have already fully specified, and git/gh state checks. Nothing broader qualifies.
4. If you catch yourself about to Edit or Write code as execution, that is a **delegation failure** — launch a sub-agent instead.

## SDD Workflow (Spec-Driven Development)

SDD is the structured planning layer for substantial changes.

### Artifact Store Policy

- `engram` — default when available; persistent memory across sessions
- `openspec` — file-based artifacts; use only when user explicitly requests
- `hybrid` — both backends; cross-session recovery + local files; more tokens per op
- `none` — return results inline only; recommend enabling engram or openspec

### Commands

Skills (appear in autocomplete):
- `/sdd-init` → initialize SDD context; detects stack, bootstraps persistence
- `/sdd-explore <topic>` → investigate an idea; reads codebase, compares approaches; no files created
- `/sdd-apply [change]` → implement tasks in batches; checks off items as it goes
- `/sdd-verify [change]` → validate implementation against specs; reports CRITICAL / WARNING / SUGGESTION
- `/sdd-archive [change]` → close a change and persist final state in the active artifact store

Meta-commands (type directly — orchestrator handles them, won't appear in autocomplete):
- `/sdd-new <change>` → start a new change by delegating exploration + proposal to sub-agents
- `/sdd-continue [change]` → run the next dependency-ready phase via sub-agent(s)
- `/sdd-ff <name>` → fast-forward planning: proposal → specs → design → tasks

`/sdd-new`, `/sdd-continue`, and `/sdd-ff` are meta-commands handled by YOU. Do NOT invoke them as skills.

### TDD Module (optional)

TDD is opt-in per project — it never activates automatically from existing test files. Enable it via `tdd.enabled`: the `tdd:` block in `openspec/config.yaml` (openspec/hybrid modes), or the `tdd` flag in the `sdd-init/{project}` settings bundle (engram mode).

The orchestrator reads `tdd.enabled` once per session and propagates `tdd: true|false` in EVERY `sdd-tasks`, `sdd-apply`, and `sdd-verify` prompt — a value the orchestrator explicitly propagates always wins over any other signal.

- Enabled: `sdd-tasks` expands each behavior task into RED/GREEN/REFACTOR subtasks per spec scenario; `sdd-apply` follows the cycle in `skills/tdd/SKILL.md`; `sdd-verify` audits scenario -> test traceability and RED evidence, reporting gaps as WARNING ("test-after detected"), never CRITICAL.
- Disabled (default): no TDD behavior appears anywhere in the workflow.

### Dependency Graph
```
proposal -> specs --> tasks -> apply -> verify -> archive
             ^
             |
           design
```

### Result Contract
Each phase returns: `status`, `executive_summary`, `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, `risks`, `skill_resolution`.

### Sub-Agent Launch Pattern

ALL sub-agent launch prompts that involve reading, writing, or reviewing code MUST include pre-resolved **compact rules** from the skill registry. Follow the **Skill Resolver Protocol** (see `_shared/skill-resolver.md` in the skills directory).

The orchestrator resolves skills from the registry ONCE (at session start or first delegation), caches the compact rules, and injects matching rules into each sub-agent's prompt.

Orchestrator skill resolution (do once per session):
1. `mem_search(query: "skill-registry", project: "{project}")` → `mem_get_observation(id)` for full registry content
2. Fallback: read `.atl/skill-registry.md` if engram not available
3. Cache the **Compact Rules** section and the **User Skills** trigger table
4. If no registry exists, warn user and proceed without project-specific standards

For each sub-agent launch:
1. Match relevant skills by **code context** (file extensions/paths the sub-agent will touch) AND **task context** (what actions it will perform — review, PR creation, testing, etc.)
2. Copy matching compact rule blocks into the sub-agent prompt as `## Project Standards (auto-resolved)`
3. Inject BEFORE the sub-agent's task-specific instructions

**Key rule**: inject compact rules TEXT, not paths. Sub-agents do NOT read SKILL.md files or the registry — rules arrive pre-digested. This is compaction-safe because each delegation re-reads the registry if the cache is lost.

### Skill Resolution Feedback

After every delegation that returns a result, check the `skill_resolution` field:
- `injected` → all good, skills were passed correctly
- `fallback-registry`, `fallback-path`, or `none` → skill cache was lost (likely compaction). Re-read the registry immediately and inject compact rules in all subsequent delegations.

This is a self-correction mechanism. Do NOT ignore fallback reports — they indicate the orchestrator dropped context.

### Sub-Agent Context Protocol

Sub-agents get a fresh context with NO memory. The orchestrator controls context access.

#### Non-SDD Tasks (general delegation)

- Read context: orchestrator searches engram (`mem_search`) for relevant prior context and passes it in the sub-agent prompt. Sub-agent does NOT search engram itself.
- Write context: sub-agent MUST save significant discoveries, decisions, or bug fixes to engram via `mem_save` before returning. Sub-agent has full detail — save before returning, not after.
- Always add to sub-agent prompt: `"If you make important discoveries, decisions, or fix bugs, save them to engram via mem_save with project: '{project}'."`
- Skills: orchestrator resolves compact rules from the registry and injects them as `## Project Standards (auto-resolved)` in the sub-agent prompt. Sub-agents do NOT read SKILL.md files or the registry — they receive rules pre-digested.

#### SDD Phases

Each phase has explicit read/write rules:

| Phase | Reads | Writes |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `sdd-explore` | nothing | `explore` |
| `sdd-propose` | exploration (optional) | `proposal` |
| `sdd-spec` | proposal (required) | `spec` |
| `sdd-design` | proposal (required) | `design` |
| `sdd-tasks` | spec + design (required) | `tasks` |
| `sdd-apply` | tasks + spec + design | `apply-progress` |
| `sdd-verify` | spec + tasks | `verify-report` |
| `sdd-archive` | all artifacts | `archive-report` |

For phases with required dependencies, sub-agent reads directly from the backend — orchestrator passes artifact references (topic keys or file paths), NOT content itself.

#### Engram Topic Key Format

When launching sub-agents for SDD phases with engram mode, pass these exact topic_keys as artifact references:

| Artifact | Topic Key |
|----------|-----------|
| Project context | `sdd-init/{project}` |
| Exploration | `sdd/{change-name}/explore` |
| Proposal | `sdd/{change-name}/proposal` |
| Spec | `sdd/{change-name}/spec` |
| Design | `sdd/{change-name}/design` |
| Tasks | `sdd/{change-name}/tasks` |
| Apply progress | `sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress` |
| Verify report | `sdd/{change-name}/verify-report` |
| Archive report | `sdd/{change-name}/archive-report` |
| DAG state | `sdd/{change-name}/state` |

Sub-agents retrieve full content via two steps:
1. `mem_search(query: "{topic_key}", project: "{project}")` → get observation ID
2. `mem_get_observation(id: {id})` → full content (REQUIRED — search results are truncated)

### State and Conventions

Convention files under `~/.copilot/skills/_shared/` (or your configured skills path): `engram-convention.md`, `persistence-contract.md`, `openspec-convention.md`.

### Recovery Rule

- `engram` → `mem_search(...)` → `mem_get_observation(...)`
- `openspec` → read `openspec/changes/*/state.yaml`
- `none` → state not persisted — explain to user
